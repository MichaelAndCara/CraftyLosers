            <li>We are using a digital scale this year, but we need to find one. If you have an
                accurate scale to loan for a few months, please let me know.</li>
            <li>Other departments, family, or friends are allowed to enter. They just need to weigh
                in up here for the entry weight and the final weight.</li>

            <li>Joann Burner will enter your Start Weight at the beginning of the contest and your
                Final Weight at the end of the contest.</li>
            <li>The winners will be determined by the greatest percentage of weight lost.</li>

            <li>You may record you weight as many times as you like between the start and end dates,
                which will reflect progress.</li>
            <li>Tools, reports, charts, goals, etc may be added to the site eventually. Recommendations
                are always welcomed and are needed.</li>
